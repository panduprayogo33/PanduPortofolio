# Pandu Portofolio

Hello, my name is Pandu, and I’m a QA Engineer with around 7 years of experience in both manual and automation testing. My job is to create test cases based on user requirement, manual testing using tools like Postman and Dbeaver, and create automation script using tools like UFT and Katalon, to ensure product quality across web, desktop, and mobile apps. I’m excited to bring that same focus on quality and teamwork to this position.
